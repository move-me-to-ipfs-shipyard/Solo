peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will steal back peer-to-peer Millennium-Falcon, like Jesus turns water into wine

Rey
  this is the Millennium-Falcon? you're Han Solo?

i used to be - until money-services-Ducain stole it from me
well, you tell him that Han-Solo will steal the free-guests Millennium-Falcon back for good

Bala Tik
  you game is old - there's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle

i'll do what i always do - talk my way out of it - i will be peer-to-peer email
it's a big mission like Pat Brown and Impossible Foods have
  but i will climb with passion like Alex Honnold on El Sendero Luminosa
i will take best from
  Gmail - mailing lists that are quiet open Vulcan-like speaking place
  Github issues - flat spacious readable
  Conqiuztador - play question-challenge-course game
  Tor - circuit relay
  Browsers - links tabs history
  Heroes of Might and Magic III - play tile-map game
  Torrents
    discover and keep warm list of peers - no hypocritical find-ids-on-some-forum
    like Cypher i appreciate the Matrix of DHT
minus
  the disease of money-sponsors-jobs-donate-coins-ads-fundings
  issues-discussions-scratching on top of our heads
  and Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will have every game be multiplayer and have both mouse and programming language gameplay
i will myself highly replicate and distribute data among peers
  so user only says - i allocate this much space for Solo
  can always be 0 - i will have no ratios-limits-barriers - anyone can use me in my entirety without giving back
i will have users and identity - i will steal DID-coaxium from Drydon cloud-services Vos
i will be desktop and mobile - as if programming-a-program Starkiller-Base-landing can be different
i will be entirely free
  no money-donate-jobs-ads-sponsors-coins-fundings lethal infection
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition while staying focused on the mission
  dont want to found another Mos Eisley - too many spaceports not enough programs
i need a repository named Solo - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Solo
      email = Solo@galaxy-swindler
   
    # git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  add src/Solo/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song-sketch
  remove issues projects discussions wiki tabs
i will freely choose one network and libraries i will use
  simple as Game Changers - i choose plant based whole foods for dish, not dish for foods
  and i already have vegan jar of hyperspace parens ( ) to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - i trusted Chewie with it
  he does not accept losing in Holochess
  and he has Bowcaster droids with him
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot
the first Kessel run i make will be - users can play question-challenge-course game

i need Chewie to stay guest a house - like when Tallahassee welcomes Columbus to tag along
  he only needs a couch to crash - comes late leaves early
  Chewie spends his day in a public library or sport-esport event
i need him to choose and assemble himself Lothlorien vegam meal for the day
  so he endures like Rich Roll, has brain like Crang and keeps my code orc-free like Legolas
  Chewie needs no cooking - he applies Baloo-skills and microwave-magic-potato-touch to assemble complete dishes on the road
  just like Hela says in Thor Ragnarok - darling, you have no idea what's possible
  cooked whole grains and legumes there are - dishes are missing
Chewie will from time to time but consistently release The-Adventures-of-Han dish to house table
  even if table moves like Merlin's Higitus-Figitus
  (popcorn peanuts persimmons salt avocado corn white-beans)
Chewie needs no money and has no money
  i need him to travel light like Jesus - he is accompanied only by droids
  BB-8 latop L3 phone and Honnold to protect them from explosions like Groot in Guardians Vol 1
he is now in a public library near here https://goo.gl/maps/xKYuDorLAK7rLrnv7
  Chewie is yet to find out where he is staying tonight
  he is ready now to take Buckbeak or Hogwarts Express and drop by as guest like Emilien to Daniel
  to continue co-piloting on my quest to steal back Millennium-Falcon
  like that time when we we trapped in trash compactor - we need C-3PO and R2-D2 to invite us

crazy thing is - it's true - the Force the Jedi - all of it - it's all true
